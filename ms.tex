\title{Natural Language Processing in Software Testing:\\ A Systematic Literature Review}

                  As Natural Language Processing (NLP) has made huge strides over the
                  last few years, its adoption and use in Software Testing has been
                  growing apace. As a result, there has already been a wealth of
                  applications of NLP in Software Testing. This presents opportunities
                  for Software Engineering practice, but also challenges for further,
                  widespread adoption, with questions such as: What are the NLP
                  techniques that are most commonly used? In which phases and types of
                  Software Testing are they applied? To help answer these questions we
                  have undertaken an extensive systematic literature review. The results
                  of the review show that most NLP applications in Software Testing are
                  tool-based, they are mostly based on popular NLP techniques, while
                  more modern NLP techniques are also making inroads. By mapping the NLP
                  in Software Testing landscape, our results can be of value to
                  practitioners and researchers alike.
