abstract = {Converting source or unit test code to English has been shown to improve the maintainability, understandability, and analysis of software and tests. Code summarizers identify 'important' statements in the source/tests and convert them to easily understood English sentences using static analysis and NLP techniques. However, current test summarization approaches handle only a subset of the variation and customization allowed in the JUnit assert API (a critical component of test cases) which may affect the accuracy of conversions. In this paper, we present our work towards improving JUnit test summarization with a detailed process for converting a total of 45 unique JUnit assertions to English, including 37 previously-unhandled variations of the assertThat method. This process has also been implemented and released as the AssertConvert tool. Initial evaluations have shown that this tool generates English conversions that accurately represent a wide variety of assertion statements which could be used for code summarization or other NLP analyses.},

abstract = {Achieving high software quality today involves manual analysis, test planning, documentation of testing strategy and test cases, and the development of scripts to support automated regression testing. To keep pace with software evolution, test artifacts must also be frequently updated. Although test automation practices help mitigate the cost of regression testing, a large gap exists between the current paradigm and fully automated software testing. Researchers and practitioners are realizing the potential for artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) to help bridge the gap between the testing capabilities of humans and those of machines. This paper presents an ML approach that combines a language specification that includes a grammar that can be used to describe test flows, and a trainable test flow generation model, in order to generate tests in a way that is trainable, reusable across different applications, and generalizable to new applications.},

abstract = {One of the challenging issues in improving the test efficiency is that of achieving a balance between testing goals and testing resources. Test execution scheduling is one way of saving time and budget, where a set of test cases are grouped and tested at the same time. To have an optimal test execution schedule, all related information of a test case (e.g. execution time, functionality to be tested, dependency and similarity with other test cases) need to be analyzed. Test scheduling problem becomes more complicated at high-level testing, such as integration testing and especially in manual testing procedure. Test specifications are generally written in natural text by humans and usually contain ambiguity and uncertainty. Therefore, analyzing a test specification demands a strong learning algorithm. In this position paper, we propose a natural language processing-based approach that, given test specifications at the integration level, allows automatic detection of test cases semantic dependencies. The proposed approach utilizes the Doc2Vec algorithm and converts each test case into a vector in n-dimensional space. These vectors are then grouped using the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm into semantic clusters. Finally, a set of cluster-based test scheduling strategies are proposed for execution. The proposed approach has been applied in a sub-system from the railway domain by analyzing an ongoing testing project at Bombardier Transportation AB, Sweden.},

abstract = {For large industrial applications, system test cases are still often described in natural language (NL), and their number can reach thousands. Test automation is to automatically execute the test cases. Achieving test automation typically requires substantial manual effort for creating executable test scripts from these NL test cases. In particular, given that each NL test case consists of a sequence of NL test steps, testers first implement a test API method for each test step and then write a test script for invoking these test API methods sequentially for test automation. Across different test cases, multiple test steps can share semantic similarities, supposedly mapped to the same API method. However, due to numerous test steps in various NL forms under manual inspection, testers may not realize those semantically similar test steps and thus waste effort to implement duplicate test API methods for them. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a new approach based on natural language processing to cluster similar NL test steps together such that the test steps in each cluster can be mapped to the same test API method. Our approach includes domain-specific word embedding training along with measurement based on Relaxed Word Mover’sDistance to analyze the similarity of test steps. Our approach also includes a technique to combine hierarchical agglomerative clustering and K-means clustering post-refinement to derive high-quality and manually-adjustable clustering results. The evaluation results of our approach on a large industrial mobile app, WeChat, show that our approach can cluster the test steps with high accuracy, substantially reducing the number of clusters and thus reducing the downstream manual effort. In particular, compared with the baseline approach, our approach achieves 79.8% improvement on cluster quality, reducing 65.9% number of clusters, i.e., the number of test API methods to be implemented.},
