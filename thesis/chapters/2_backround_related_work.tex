\chapter*{Backround and Related Work}
This section sets the scene around the topic areas that will be discussed in this paper. Firstly, we describe basic information about the concept of NLP and we also 
provide some context related to Software Testing phases and processes. Then we briefly present studies we found that are similar to this one, compare them and consequently, 
identify the gap that this paper targets to fill. 

\section {Overview of NLP and Software Testing}

\section{Related Work}

Several other papers have been created that are close to the currently studied area. Four such studies where found \cite{garousi2020nlp,battina2019artificial,ahsan2017comprehensive,escalona2011overview} 
and are shortly presented in this section. Garousi et al. \cite{garousi2020nlp}, conducted a Systematic Literature Mapping regarding NLP-assisted software testing methods suggested in a pool 
of 67 papers. This mapping study classifies and overviews a list of 38 identified tools. Goal of this paper was to provide practicioners with useful information about the reasons for which 
the use of such tools might benefit their current practise. Moreover, Ahsan et al \cite{ahsan2017comprehensive}, investigated 16 papers which contained a total of 6 NLP-based techniques and 
18 tools with the same purpose. \\

Trudova et al \cite{battina2019artificial}, created a Systematic Literature Review aiming to highlight the role of Artificial Intelligence in Automation Testing. 
They explore the influence of AI on the testing processes without focusing only on NLP techniques. The authors reviewed 34 papers where they identified 9 distinct software testing activities. 
The last study identified was the one conducted by Escalona et al \cite{escalona2011overview}, which focuses on NLP techniques regarding the automation of the test cases generation process. 
The analysis was performed between 24 approaches with a goal to determine the state of the art in the related area. The summary of the identified studies is displayed in Table 1 below.\\

Having made a short reference to the already existing work, we notice that none of the above papers focus on NLP techniques, different application types (tool, framework, algorithm etc.) and 
different stages of software testing at the same time. In this paper, we emphasize on studies that refer to NLP techniques, possibly propose a variety of approach types and can improve different phases 
of the Software Testing stages (e.g. requirement analysis, implementation, execution). We aim to form a broader overview of the way that NLP and Software Testing fields now cooperate to optimize 
the quality of software.
