                        With the amount of knowledge around Natural Language Processing in Software Testing constantly growing, there is a need to provide a clear overview of the state-of-the-art 
                        technologies to the scientific community and practitioners. This Systematic Literature Review classifies recent NLP applications in Software Testing. We organize 
                        the already existing knowledge from a total of 44 scientific papers, based on Contribution Type, Software Testing Stage, 
                        Software Testing Type, Input/Output Type and NLP Techniques used in the presented context. Several findings of this review are: (1) most 
                        proposals refer to a new tool (2) many papers stick to popular NLP techniques like POS Tagging and TF-IDF to achieve their goal whereas 
                        few of them make use of more complex methods like LSTM RNNs. This review aims to make current practices and upcoming needs accessible by simplifying 
                        the searching process and providing recent organized information to be used as a starting point for further research.
