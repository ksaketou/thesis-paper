                        The incorporation of Machine Learning and AI techniques to automate Software Testing processes has been a frequent phenomenon in recent years.
                        Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the component of this family on which we ephazise on in the present paper. Since the amount of knowledge in this 
                        area is constantly growing, there is a need to organize and provide a clear overview of the state-of-the-art technologies to both the scientific 
                        community and practitioners. This thesis paper is a Systematic Literature Review of the recent proposed NLP applications in Software Testing. We organize 
                        and classify the already existing knowledge included in a total of 44 scientific papers, based on the criterias of Contribution Type, Software Testing Stage, 
                        Software Testingg Type, Input Type, Output Type and also NLP Techniques used. Several significant findings of this review are: (1) the majority of the 
                        proposals refer to a new tool (2) many papers stick to popular and well-known NLP techniques like POS Tagging and TF-IDF to achieve their goal whereas 
                        few of them make use of more complex methods like LSTM RNNs. The present paper, aims to make current practices and upcoming needs accessible by simplifying 
                        the searching process and providing recent organized information that can be used as a starting point for further research.
