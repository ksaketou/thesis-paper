Natural Language Processing in Software Testing:
A Systematic Literature Review

As Natural Language Processing (NLP) has made huge strides over the
last few years, its adoption and use in Software Testing has been
growing apace. As a result, there has already been a wealth of
applications of NLP in Software Testing. This presents opportunities
for Software Engineering practice, but also challenges for further,
widespread adoption, with questions such as: What are the NLP
techniques that are most commonly used? In which phases and types of
Software Testing are they applied? To help answer these questions we
have undertaken an extensive systematic literature review. The results
of the review show that most NLP applications in Software Testing are
tool-based, they are mostly based on popular NLP techniques, while
more modern NLP techniques are also making inroads. By mapping the NLP
in Software Testing landscape, our results can be of value to
practitioners and researchers alike.
